Analysis started: Wed Jan 30 18:29:09 2013

Options in effect:
	--file thyroid
	--epistasis
	--epi1 1
	--noweb

5 (of 5) markers to be included from [ thyroid.map ]
1850 individuals read from [ thyroid.ped ] 
1850 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
845 cases, 1005 controls and 0 missing
1310 males, 540 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 5 SNPs
1850 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 5 SNPs
After filtering, 845 cases, 1005 controls and 0 missing
After filtering, 1310 males, 540 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Converting data to Individual-major format
Writing epistasis pairwise results to [ plink.epi.cc ] 
Threshold for displaying epistatic result (--epi1) : p <= 1
Threshold for counting epistatic result (--epi2) : p <= 0.01
ALL x ALL epistasis mode
Performed a total of 10 valid SNPxSNP tests
Writing epistasis summary results to [ plink.epi.cc.summary ]
